abstract: "In the field of robotics, a major challenge isachieving high levels of autonomy with small vehicles that have limited mass and power budgets.The main motivation for designing such small vehicles is that, compared to their larger counterparts, they have the potential to be safer, andhence be available and work together in largenumbers. One of the key components in microrobotics is efficient software design to optimallyutilize the computing power available. This paper describes the computer vision and control algorithms used to achieve autonomous flight with the 30-gram tailless flapping wing robot, used to participate in the IMAV 2018 indoor micro airvehicle competition. Several tasks are discussed:line following, and circular gate detection and fly-through. The emphasis throughout this paper is on augmenting traditional techniques withthe goal to make these methods work with limited computing power while obtaining robust behaviour."
